TodoApi
<> Build a Restful CRUD API for a simple Note-Taking application using Djaango rest_framework and db.sqlight to explain how these work for beginners..

Technologies Django rest_framwork

Steps to Setup ** Install dependencies pip install Run start python manage.py runserver You can browse the apis at (https://robottodo.herokuapp.com/api/v1/todo/)
